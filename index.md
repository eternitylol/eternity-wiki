<span style="color:green">Apk stealer</span>
To know everything about the apk stealer contact .Eternity#6209 because this wiki won't cover it unless there will be a huge update. (üî•Premium Featureüî•)

<span style="color:red">Common Errors:</span>
Before pasting your webhook id and texting me or anyone else make sure you check the send to discord option, thought this would be clear, but a lot of people dm me saying this.  
If you notice something isn't working, use debug mode or dm anyone that has Owner/Admin/Helper role. And then dm me so I would include it here :trollface:


### Accounts tab

Woohoo, you finally built your stealer, now something isn't working or you just don't know to use this tab!

<span style="color:blue">Part 1</span> How do you use it?
First of all, get an account it can be yours or someone elses, doesen't matter. You might be confused since there are too many buttons to klik, but these are the basics.
Click refresh if you don't see the account, now you see their growid, password, ip and the time they opened the stealer, this should be clear. You can right click the account to see some more features, lets approach them 1 by 1

<span style="color:purple">Account Info</span>

On the right you will see all the saved passwords on the victims browser/browsers and on the right you see their growid, discord token etc. 
If you want to get the credentials to a txt file press the export button and select the location you want your creds


<span style="color:purple">Check</span>

Checks an account for you, all the info is on the right (üî•Premium Featureüî•)

<span style="color:purple">AAP Management</span>

You can bypass aap in this tab, how to do it later on in the wiki

<span style="color:purple">Delete Account</span>

Deletes the account from your accounts list

<span style="color:red">Common Errors:</span>

When checking sometimes your something can be blocked so you need a vpn to check more accounts (üî¥ETERNITY IS FIXING THISüî¥) Also make sure you select the correct version in the Misc tab
Once again, if you find any dm me and ill add it here

### Webhooks tab

You add webhooks here.
