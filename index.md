### Builder tab

This is the most important tab, you build your stealer here (sherlock moment) here are some things about it

Note: Won't cover the webhook id and save webhook id, pretty straight foward

```markdown

Copy to Startup: Boots up the stealer every computer restart
Get screenshot: Get a screenshot of their pc when they open your stealer
Send to discord: Sends the account to your webhook in your server ‚ö†Ô∏èMAKE SURE YOU ENABLE THIS BEFORE PASTING YOUR WEBHOOK ID (we will get to this later)‚ö†Ô∏è

Corrupt Growtopia: Makes that you can't connect to growtopia servers
Get Credentials: Gets all the saved passwords from browsers (google,firefox etc) (üî•Premium Featureüî•)

```

<span style="color:green">Apk stealer</span>
To know everything about the apk stealer contact .Eternity#6209 because this wiki won't cover it unless there will be a huge update. (üî•Premium Featureüî•)

<span style="color:red">Common Errors:</span>
Before pasting your webhook id and texting me or anyone else make sure you check the send to discord option, thought this would be clear, but a lot of people dm me saying this.  
If you notice something isn't working, use debug mode or dm anyone that has Owner/Admin/Helper role. And then dm me so I would include it here :trollface:


### Accounts

Woohoo, you finally built your stealer, now something isn't working or you just don't know to use this tab!

<span style="color:blue">Part 1</span> How do you use it?
First of all, get an account it can be yours or someone elses, doesen't matter. You might be confused since there are too many buttons to klik, but these are the basics.
Click refresh if you don't see the account, now you see their growid, password, ip and the time they opened the stealer, this should be clear. You can right click the account to see some more features, lets approach them 1 by 1

<span style="color:purple">Account Info</span>

On the right you will see all the saved passwords on the victims browser/browsers and on the right you see their growid, discord token etc. 
If you want to get the credentials to a txt file press the export button and select the location you want your creds


<span style="color:purple">Check</span>

Checks an account for you, all the info is on the right (üî•Premium Featureüî•)
